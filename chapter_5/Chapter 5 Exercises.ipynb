    "## Answer:\n",
    "The reason for the estimated value function to jump up for the last two rows in the rear is that the player sticks on 20 or 21, and hence has a much higher probability to win the game. The estimated value function drops off for the whole last row on the left because the dealer is in posession of an ace card, which decreases the probability for the player to win. The frontmost values are higher in the upper diagrams than in the lower ones because in the upper diagrams, the player has a \"usable\" ace card, which again increases the probability for the player to win."

    "The pseudocode for Monte Carlo ES is inefficient because, for each state-action pair, it maintains a list of all returns and repeatedly calculates their mean. It would be more efficient to use techniques similar to those explained in Section 2.4 to maintain just the mean and a count (for each state-action pair) and update them incrementally. Describe how the pseudocode would be altered to achieve this.\n",

    "## Question:\n",
    "Consider driving a race car around a turn like those shown in Figure 5.5. You want to go as fast as possible, but not so fast as to run off the track. In our simplified racetrack, the car is at ine of a discrete set of grid positions, the cells in the diagram. The velocity is also discrete, a number of grid cells moved horizontally and vertically per time step. The actions are increments to the velocity components. Each may be changed by $+1$, $-1$, or $0$ in each time step, for a total of nine ($3$ x $3$) actions. Both velocity components are restricted to be nonnegative and less than $5$, and they cannot both be zero except at the starting line. Each eposiode begins in one of the randomly selected start states with both velocity components zero, and ends when the car crosses the finish line. The rewards are $-1$ for each step until the car crosses the finish line. If the car hits the track boundary, it is moved back to a random position on the starting line, both velocity components are reduced to zero, and the episode continues. Before updating the car's location at each step, check to see if the projected path of the car intersects the track boundary. If it intersects the finish line, the episode ends; if it intersects anywhere else, the car is considered to have hit the track boundary and is sent back to the starting line. To make the task more challenging, with probability 0.1 at each time step the velocity increments are both zero, independently of the intended increments. Apply a Monte Carlo control method to this task to compute the optimal policy from each starting state. Exhibit several trajectories following the optimal policy (but turn the noise off for these trajectories). \n",
