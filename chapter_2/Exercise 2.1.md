# Exercise 2.1
  
## Question:
In ε-greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and ε = 0.5,
what is the probability thtat the greedy action is selected?

## Answer:
0.5 + 0.5 \* 0.5 = 0.75

50% of the times it'll be selected greedily (because it is the best choice) and half of the
times the action is selected randomly it will be selected by chance.
