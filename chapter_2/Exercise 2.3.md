# Exercise 2.3

## Question:
In the comparison shown in Figure 2.2, which method will perform best in the long run in
terms of cumulative reward and cumulative probability of selecting the best action? How much better will it be?

## Answer:
ε=0.01 will select the best action 99.1% (0.99+0.01\*0.1) of the time versus ε=0.1, that will select it 91% (0.9+0.1\*0.1).
