# Exercise 1.1: Self-Play

## Question:
Suppose, instead of playing against a random opponent, the reinforcement learning algorithm described above
played against itself. What do you think would happen in this case? Would it learn a different way of playing?

## Answer:
The algorithm will continue to adapt until it reaches an equilibrium, which may be either fixed (always making
the same moves), or cyclical. It is possible to reach a higher skill level than against a fixed opponent
but it may also take miss paths toward stronger over all play because it is reacting to itself
