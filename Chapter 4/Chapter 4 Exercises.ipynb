    "## Question:\n",
    "In Example 4.1, suppose a new state $15$ was added to the gridworld just below state $13$, and its actions, $left$, $up$, $right$ and $down$, take the agent to states $12$, $13$, $14$ and $15$, respectively. Assume that the transitions ___from___ the original states are unchanged. What, then, is $v_{\\pi}(15)$ for the equiprobable random policy? Now suppose the dynamics of state $13$ are also changed, such that action $down$ from state $13$ takes the agent to the new state $15$. What is $v_{\\pi}(15)$ for the equiprobable random policy in this case?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "With still unchanged transitions ___from___ the original states, there is no way to get to state $15$ unless already in it (because $p(13|13,down) = 1$ and $p(15|13,down) = 0$). Therefore, no other state's value is dependent upon state $15$ than state $15$ itself.\n",

    "Seven state value update iterations using the below equation are sufficient for $v(15)$ to clearly approximate -20:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "v_{\\pi}(15) = \\frac{1}{4} \\big( v_{\\pi}(12) - 1 + [v_{\\pi}(13) - 1 + [v_{\\pi}(14) - 1 + [v_{\\pi}(15) - 1 \\big) \\\\\n",

    "With the change in dynamics of state $13$, there is now a path to state $15$ - from state $13$. The value of state $13$ (and, subsequently, of all of its possible predecessor states) would need to be updated to reflect the new dynamics. To update the value state from $v_{\\pi, old}(13)$ to $v_{\\pi, new}(13)$, one would only need to substitute $v_{\\pi}(13)$ by $v_{\\pi}(15)$ to reflect the action $down$ - the rest of the calculation remains the same. However, the problem states $v_{*}(13)= -20$ and we already arrived at $v_{*}(15) = -20$. Hence, the value of state $13$ will remain effectively unchanged, and so will its possible predecessor states' values. "
